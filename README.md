# Rat in a Maze Visualizer
This is a web application that allows you to visualize the famous "Rat in a Maze" problem. The problem involves a rat that needs to find its way from the top left corner of a maze to the bottom right corner, where a piece of cheese is waiting. The maze is represented by a grid of cells, some of which may be blocked and cannot be traversed by the rat.

The application allows you to customize the size of the maze (up to 8x8), the speed at which the rat moves, and the ability to add custom obstacles to the maze. You can watch the rat move step by step towards the cheese, and see the shortest path that it takes to get there.

## Getting Started
To use the Rat in a Maze Visualizer, simply go to the following URL in your web browser:

Open https://rat-in-maze-visualizer.netlify.app/
From there, you can select the size of the maze, the speed at which the rat moves, and add custom obstacles to the maze using your mouse. Once you're ready, click the "Start" button to watch the rat navigate its way to the cheese.
